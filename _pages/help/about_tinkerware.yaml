Introducing Tinkerware - Agile is Better.
===

Every time you waste time on things that should be automated,
a Unicorn dies. True story.

Why? Because it means you're wasting LIFE on things you souldn't
You need to be more efficient.

For companies it's the same, and here's the solution for any company that
develops software somehow. 

Evolve software delivery now.
With extra efficient developers. 

Use our platform to apply DevOps principles in seconds. 

Following these priciples companies will improve **productivity up to 80%** with:

|   In Business                             | In Numbers                          |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|   **Finish projects** so much faster      | 2555x **Lead times reduction**      |
|   **Don't worry** if something goes wrong | 24x **Faster** failure **recovery** |
|   Fail Quickly, **Improve quickly**       | 3x **Less failures** on change      |
|   Users can see **constant updates**      | 200x More frequent **deploys**      |


Don't waste time installing and configuring stuff. Cut to the chase and start giving value.

To achieve this, there are some things that should be done. 

1. Improve IT Department.
## Basic structured steps
Develop locally, Test, Deploy.

2. ## Automate
Repetitive tasks and unplanned work take normally more than 80% of the time.

3. ## Learn and evolve

4. ## Focus on your tasks. Code hapily and freely

# They take at least a year to apply them from scratch and being productive.
Why not make it in 5 minutes? 



# Here's MyDevOp platform for you.

  - Provide automatic software development environments in seconds. Dev/Test/Prod 
    to connect your repos or start from scratch
  - Powerful and easy to use infrastructure according to your needs. 
  - Automatic tools and integrations to your projects. DBs, CIs, Security, Frameworks and more...
  
You're done. 

Download a working project to improve it. Once it's better, Deploy it again... 

Now you can keep track of your projects, the services they have on them and how halthy are they. 
Improve it at any time, and deploy it anytime to any server.

You don't need an expert anymore, or become super efficient if you're the expert. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  - Choose between server providers
  - Configure your server
  - Secure your server
  - Deploy your code
  - Keep an eye on your server
  - Hope that nothing will break.

...a lot of times it's hard to find the time to do all this.

## choose between
## server providers, configuring your server, deploying your code and keeping
## an eye on your server to keep your stuff available.

This "small" step is the difference between (hopefully) *creating a great
service used by a lot of people* and  - forgetting about that cool small project
you once did in the past...

Other times, paying third parties to perform all these tasks is not an option
since it gets expensive, so why not making these configurations easy for you
and let you handle your own server with freedom with the posibility of growth?

*You can achieve this* with *environments*.
That project you created in your computer is your developent stage and we can
sync it to your production server replicating the environment. That way, any time
you want to add more functionality, it won't be a problem. The deploy will
be transparent and easy by then and you will have your own server at your
disposal at any time if you need it.

But how does it work?
---

You'd basically do the following:

  - Log in with your account.
  - Select what you want to be installed in your server.
  - Upload to the server the code you want to deploy there.
  - Add your ssh-keys to access.
  - Enjoy! Your code should be working now.

After that you'll get:

  - A development environment to work with. (Using [Vagrant](www.vagrant.com))
    ( Your vagrant will be just as your production server to avoid compatibility issues)
  - Access to your server.
  - Access to a dashboard to make all the steps easily.
  - A full list of your projects to manage.
  - Access to modules to complement your server.

Some of the modules to complement your server would include:

  - Basic security
  - Advanced security
  - Load balancers
  - Monitoring
  - Concurrency/Requests control.

We're cururrently developing the base of all this functionality but we're
glad to say that it is coming soon.
All of this gets automated for your easier management (and ours too), that's
why we will be adding more modules, features and cool stuff depending on how
the users guide us.

Feel free to contact us at hello@tinkerware.io and subscribe to our waiting list
We're releasing Beta soon for you to manage your servers without headaches.
