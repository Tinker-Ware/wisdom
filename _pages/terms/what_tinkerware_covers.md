Unless otherwise provided herein, this SLA is subject to the terms of the TinkerWare Agreement and capitalized terms will have the meaning specified in the TinkerWare Agreement. We reserve the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with the TinkerWare Agreement.

In this article, we describe more precisely the Tasks of Tinkerware as a Service.
This will help to have a more clear view of what does [TinkerWare support](tinkerware-support.slack.com/signin) covers when using our
Services and what we would expect you to have as main knowledge of some technologies
to really take advantage of our Plattform and keep a smooth ride.

We use the concepts of code as an infrastructure and disposable infraestructure. We provide a platafform to configure instantly virtual machines (Vagrant or Docker) for local environments and connect repositories and the tools provided to different server providers such as Digital Ocean, AWS or even in-hose servers, with a variety of different tools supported by us.

## Servers

Tinkerware does not provide a Servers service, nor the specs you need for your project to work, this has to be defined by your team, we don't take responsability for the charges the servers company could charge you.
